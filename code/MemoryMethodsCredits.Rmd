## Memory load and processing time

The maximum memory load in this run was $`r (gc())[1,6] + (gc())[2,6]  `$ Mb .
It took `r format(Sys.time() - start.Time)` of processing time.


## Methods

We will draft an example methods part for papers.
(in the processing)

## Credits

The code for the CPACOR analysis pipeline was adapted from Lehne et. al. (Genome Biology, 2015)
which was developed and written by Benjamin Lehne (Imperial College London) and Alexander Drong
(Oxford University).
The code for the low-level quality control was developed and written by Alexander Teumer
(University Medicine Greifswald/ Erasmus MC Rotterdam).
The code was combined into the current pipeline by Pascal Schlosser and Franziska Grundner-Culemann.
It is available at https://github.com/genepi-freiburg/Infinium-preprocessing.

See *A coherent approach for analysis of the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip improves quality and performance in epigenome-wide association studies* by Lehne et. al., Genome Biology (2015)
for the basic idea. The method was then extended to EPIC arrays.
