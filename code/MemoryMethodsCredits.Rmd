## Memory load and processing time

The maximum memory load in this run was $`r (gc())[1,6] + (gc())[2,6]  `$ Mb .
It took `r format(Sys.time() - start.Time)` of processing time.


## Methods

We will draft an example methods part for papers.

## Credits

The code for this pipeline was written by Benjamin Lehne (Imperial College London) and Alexander Drong (Oxford University), extended by Alexander Teumer (University Medicine Greifswald/ Erasmus MC Rotterdam) and combined into the pipeline by Pascal Schlosser and Franziska Grundner-Culemann in 2017. 

See *A coherent approach for analysis of the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip improves quality and performance in epigenome-wide association studies* by Lehne et. al., Genome Biology (2015)
for the basic idea. The method was then extended to EPIC arrays.
